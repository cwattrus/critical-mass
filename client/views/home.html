  	<h2>Hello, ThoughtWorker.</h2>
  	<p>Yup, we’re a little wacky. So we fit right in with the rest of you ;). 
	We have a new way of working.</p>

	<p>We’ve self organised into groups of 2, 3 or 4 people who own and manage a stream of work.
	No stories, no up front analysis, but rather continuous design, lots of user testing
	and most importantly lots of trial and error.</p>
